# GIF to stacked PNG converter

Outputs a PNG file with every frame of the input GIF placed directly under previous one in most literal way<br/>
Built into executable using PyInstaller<br/>
I use it to make animated textures for items in Minecraft<br/>

## vids(!?)

Btw, my windows defender didn't allow me to built it, so I had to disable it for a minute ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€<br/>

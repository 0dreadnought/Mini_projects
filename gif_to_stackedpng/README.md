# GIF to stacked PNG converter

Outputs a PNG file with every frame of the input GIF placed directly under previous one in most literal way
Built into executable using PyInstaller
I use it to make animated textures for items in Minecraft

## vids(!?)

Btw, my windows defender didn't allow me to built it, so I had to disable it for a minute ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
